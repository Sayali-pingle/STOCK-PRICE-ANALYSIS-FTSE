# STOCK-PRICE-ANALYSIS-FTSE
The Python codes are used for the technical and predictive analysis for one company.
this is the technical analysis and predicitve analysis of stock prices of vodafone. 
Similar code was used to analyse another 30 companies as per the requirement of the project assigned by my University.
5 year daily data is used from yahoo finance
for predicitve analysis:
in Stacked LSTM and SVR Model code, help was taken from youtube and other github codes.
hence, this is not my original code for Stacked LSTM and SVR.
